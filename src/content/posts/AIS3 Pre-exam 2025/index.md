## Misc

> Use your favorite editor theme for your blog!

Theming for the website comes from builtin Shiki themes found in Expressive Code. You can view them [here](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes). A website can have one or more themes, defined in `src/site.config.ts`. There are three theming modes to choose from:

1. `single`: Choose a single theme for the website. Simple.
2. `light-dark-auto`: Choose two themes for the website to use for light and dark mode. The header will include a button for toggling between light/dark/auto. For example, you could choose `github-dark` and `github-light` with a default of `"auto"` and the user's experience will match their operating system theme straight away.
3. `select`: Choose two or more themes for the website and include a button in the header to change between any of these themes. You could include as many Shiki themes from Expressive Code as you like. Allow users to find their favorite theme!

> When the user changes the theme, their preference is stored in `localStorage` to persist across page navigation.
